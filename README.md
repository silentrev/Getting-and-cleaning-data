## Getting and Cleaning Data Project 1

### Project description 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Running the function

1. Download and place the data on your harddrive. (See codebook for url source)
2. Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of the data set 
3. Then set it as your working directory using setwd() function in R.
4. Run "run_analysis.R" and it will generate a new file "tiny_data.txt" in your working directory.
